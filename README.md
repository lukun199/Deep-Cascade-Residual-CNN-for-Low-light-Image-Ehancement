# Deep-Cascade-Residual-CNN-for-Low-light-Image-Ehancement
In this project, we explored a new deep cascade residual CNN which is designed for low-level Image-Enhancement tasks, where this framework is now tested in the low-light Image ehancement environment. This framework is composed of several detachable Sub-U_net , which takes both the high-level and low-level features as its input so as to generate a fine low-light image. In the middle-scale experiment, we fond that this network had already outperformed the vast majoryt of the model and achieved the SOTA results. Moreover, our ntework significantly reduces the total paremeters compared with several methods proposed in 2018 and 2019. We suppose this network structure could also be used in other low-level image enhancement tasks.

Since we are still working in this project, we would not release our source code till publication. The ablation experiments are now undergoing.  

However, some the enhanced low-light imagses is available here.
